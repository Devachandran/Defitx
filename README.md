# DeFitX Coaching

This is a single-page React + Vite + Tailwind project prepared for one-click deployment on Vercel.

## Quick local steps
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deploy on Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Choose "Import" and upload this ZIP (or link to your Git repository).
3. Vercel will detect a Vite project and deploy automatically.
4. After deployment you will get a public URL like `https://your-project.vercel.app`.

## Login details
- Password (shared): `defitx2025`
- Login uses email + password. "Remember Me" will persist the session in localStorage.
- Multi-user: Each different email stores separate client & activity data in browser localStorage.

## Notes
- This project stores everything client-side (localStorage). If you want server-side multi-user data (real accounts across devices), I can help integrate Firebase or Supabase.
